    <p>Happy New Year Everyone! I am from the Federated States Of Micronesia
        I hope you guys know where that is. It is a very small country dwelling 
        in the middle of the pacific Ocean. If you want to locate it on the map,
        it is just a dot swimming in the ocean. It is located near Guam(U.S Territory).
        Anyway What you guys want to know about me? Well I am 33 years old now and 
        I am single.I was converted into the church 6 years back. I am working as
         Dental lab Technician,mostly dealing with patients' dentures and fake teeth.
         It is not really my field of interest but I am glad I am helping people 
         who doesnt have teeth, creating smiles for them. I always wanted to 
        pursuing my career in Business. However I am very thankful to have the 
        opportunity to be part of this learning system. One thing I love about 
        BYU-Idaho is that its students and Instructors have so much respect and 
        high standards in learning. And it is also the best place to learn and 
        grow both in temporal and spiritual. I believe this class have all the 
        tools that will help me create my own Business web page and I am 
        very excited to be part of it.
