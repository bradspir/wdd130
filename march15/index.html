            the things that we are thankful for in life. It's a day when family

            fun to enjoy on thanksgivng day. It is our only local special dishes
            to serve on our thanksgiving day. It has its own meaning, for the
            taro- as a reminder for the labors of those yesterday for our
            blessings of today. And for the ills- is our king of the sea and for
            us to include it in the menu, as something to remind us the
            blessings of the sea. So however on our thanksgiving day we get ills
